# Architecture Guidelines - Gyllencreutz Family Heritage Website

## Backend Architecture Overview

The Gyllencreutz Family Heritage Website employs a **dual backend architecture** designed for optimal development workflow and production deployment:

- **Development Environment**: Express.js server running locally for rapid iteration and testing
- **Production Environment**: Azure Functions v4 model deployed via Azure Static Web Apps
- **Data Storage**: JSON-based genealogical records with 148+ family members
- **Architecture Pattern**: RESTful API design with consistent endpoints across both environments

Both backend implementations provide identical API responses and functionality, ensuring seamless transition from development to production. The architecture supports real-time family tree visualization, search capabilities, and bilingual content delivery.

### Core Principles
- **Consistency**: Identical API contracts between development and production
- **Simplicity**: JSON-based data storage for genealogical records
- **Scalability**: Azure Functions provide automatic scaling for traffic spikes
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns with shared data access logic

## Data Management

### Data Source
- **File Location**: `functions/data/family-members.json`
- **Format**: JSON array with 148+ genealogical records
- **Source**: Cleaned and processed data from Gyllencreutz family research
- **Size**: ~77KB of genealogical data

### Data Loading Strategy
- **Development**: Express server loads from `attached_assets/` directory
- **Production**: Azure Functions load from `functions/data/` directory
- **Admin Operations**: Azure Functions write directly to `functions/data/family-members.json`
- **Initialization**: Data loaded once at startup and cached in memory for read operations
- **Processing**: Raw JSON transformed into structured family member objects
- **Backup System**: Automatic timestamped backups created before bulk operations

### Data Persistence
- **Admin Interface**: Real-time data editing through Azure Functions
- **File-based Storage**: Direct JSON file manipulation for data persistence
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all data modifications
- **Auto-incrementing IDs**: Automatic ID generation for new family members
- **Relationship Integrity**: Validation of father references and genealogical connections
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic commits to repository for all data changes with [data-only] prefix

### GitHub Sync System
- **Automatic Commits**: All admin data changes automatically commit to GitHub repository
- **GitHub API Integration**: Uses Fine-Grained Personal Access Tokens for secure repository access
- **Commit Message Format**: `[data-only] admin: <operation description>` to identify admin changes
- **Deployment Filtering**: GitHub Actions skip site deployments for [data-only] commits
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry system (5min â†’ hourly) for failed sync operations
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time sync status with admin interface widget
- **Dual Environment Support**: Available in both Express (development) and Azure Functions (production)

### Smart Backup System
- **GitHub Storage**: Backups stored in repository `/backups` folder, not locally or on production
- **Smart Naming**: `family-data_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss_[trigger].json` format with ISO timestamps
- **Backup Types**: Three trigger types with different retention policies
  - `manual` - User-initiated backups, **never auto-deleted** (permanent retention)
  - `auto-bulk` - Created before bulk operations, auto-cleanup keeps last 5
  - `pre-restore` - Created before restore operations, auto-cleanup keeps last 3
- **Safety Features**: Pre-restore backup automatically created before any restore operation
- **Auto-cleanup**: Intelligent retention that preserves manual backups while managing auto-backups
- **Real-time UI**: Admin interface shows backup list with metadata (timestamp, member count, file size)

### Data Structure
The JSON data contains flat records that are processed into hierarchical family relationships:
- **Flat Structure**: Individual records with parent references
- **Field Mapping**: JSON fields (Born, Died, MonarchDuringLife) mapped to frontend schema (born, died, monarchDuringLife)
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Frontend converts to tree structure for visualization
- **Search Indexing**: In-memory filtering by name and notes content
- **Type Safety**: Data validation and transformation through shared schemas
- **Monarch Data**: String arrays parsed from Python-style format to JavaScript arrays

### Storage Interface
Both backend implementations use a common storage interface with full CRUD capabilities and GitHub sync:
```javascript
class FunctionStorage {
  // Read Operations
  async getAllFamilyMembers()         // Returns all family members
  async searchFamilyMembers(query)    // Filters members by search term
  async getFamilyMember(id)           // Gets specific member by externalId
  
  // Write Operations
  async createFamilyMember(data)      // Creates new member with auto-generated ID + GitHub sync
  async updateFamilyMember(id, data)  // Updates existing member by externalId + GitHub sync
  async deleteFamilyMember(id)        // Removes member by externalId + GitHub sync
  async bulkUpdateFamilyMembers(data) // Mass update/create operations + GitHub sync
  
  // Data Persistence
  async persistToFile()               // Writes changes to JSON file
  async createBackup()                // Creates timestamped backup before bulk ops
}

class GitHubSync {
  // GitHub Integration
  async syncFamilyData(operation, memberData, familyData) // Commits changes to GitHub
  async testConnection()              // Tests GitHub API authentication
  async manualRetry()                 // Manually retry failed operations
  getStatus()                         // Returns current sync status and metrics
  getSyncLogs()                       // Returns sync operation history
  
  // Backup Management
  async createBackup(familyData, trigger) // Creates backup with smart naming and auto-cleanup
  async listBackups()                      // Lists all backups with metadata, handles missing folder
  async getBackupContent(filename)         // Retrieves backup content for restore operations
  async cleanupOldBackups(trigger)         // Auto-cleanup preserving manual backups
}
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Azure Static Web Apps Integration
- **Frontend**: Static files deployed to Azure CDN from `dist/public/`
- **Backend**: Azure Functions automatically deployed from `functions/` directory
- **Build Process**: GitHub Actions trigger builds on repository updates
- **Configuration**: `staticwebapp.config.json` defines routing and function integration

### Azure Functions v4 Model
- **Programming Model**: Code-based bindings using `@azure/functions` package
- **Entry Point**: Single `main.js` file imports all function handlers
- **Function Structure**: Individual functions in `src/functions/` directory
- **No Configuration Files**: Eliminates function.json files for simplified deployment
- **Route Definition**: Routes defined in code using `app.http()` declarations

### Development vs Production Differences

| Aspect | Development (Express) | Production (Azure Functions) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Runtime** | Node.js with tsx | Azure Functions Node.js runtime |
| **Data Path** | `attached_assets/` | `functions/data/` |
| **Port** | 5000 | Managed by Azure |
| **Scaling** | Single instance | Auto-scaling |
| **Deployment** | Instant restart | GitHub Actions build |
| **Data Write** | Full CRUD operations | Full CRUD via admin interface |

### File Deployment Considerations
- **Data Inclusion**: `functions/package.json` explicitly includes data files
- **Path Resolution**: Absolute path resolution for consistent Azure deployment
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging for deployment troubleshooting
- **Debugging**: Dedicated endpoint for verifying deployment integrity

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Code Push**: Changes pushed to GitHub repository
2. **Build Trigger**: Azure Static Web Apps detects changes
3. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React application to `dist/public/`
4. **Function Deploy**: Azure packages and deploys functions from `functions/`
5. **Integration Test**: Automated verification of API endpoints
6. **Live Deployment**: Updated site available on custom domain

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all data modifications
- **GitHub Authentication**: Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens for repository access
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging and backup system for all data changes
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in Azure Functions throttling

### Future Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Azure Static Web Apps built-in authentication (GitHub, Azure AD)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for admin operations
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Key Management**: Azure Key Vault integration for secrets
