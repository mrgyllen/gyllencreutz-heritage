## API Endpoints

### Public APIs
- `GET /api/family-members` - Returns all family members with complete genealogical data
- `GET /api/family-members/search/{query}` - Searches family members by name and notes
- `GET /api/debug-deployment` - Deployment debugging and file system verification

### Admin APIs
- `GET /api/family-members/{id}` - Get specific family member by ID
- `PUT /api/family-members/{id}` - Update existing family member record
- `POST /api/family-members` - Create new family member record
- `DELETE /api/family-members/{id}` - Delete family member record
- `POST /api/family-members/bulk-update` - Bulk update operations with backup

### GitHub Sync APIs
- `GET /api/github/status` - Get GitHub sync status and connection information
- `POST /api/github/test` - Test GitHub API connection and authentication
- `POST /api/github/retry` - Manually retry failed GitHub sync operations
- `GET /api/github/logs` - Retrieve GitHub sync operation history

### Backup Management APIs

## Architecture

### Dual Backend System
- **Development Environment**: Express.js server running locally
- **Production Environment**: Azure Functions v4 model deployed via Azure Static Web Apps
- **Data Consistency**: Identical API responses across both environments
- **Scalability**: Azure Functions provide automatic scaling for traffic spikes

### Data Management
- **Primary Storage**: JSON-based genealogical records in `functions/data/family-members.json`
- **Backup System**: GitHub-based automatic backups with smart retention policies
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic commits for all admin data changes
- **Optional Database**: Azure Cosmos DB integration for advanced scenarios

### Security & Reliability
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all data modifications
- **Backup Safety**: Pre-restore backups created automatically
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed GitHub sync operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data changes

## Data Structure

### Family Member Schema
```typescript
{
  id: number,              // Unique identifier
  externalId: string,      // Original data ID
  name: string,            // Full name
  born: number | null,     // Birth year
  died: number | null,     // Death year
  biologicalSex: string,   // Male/Female
  notes: string | null,    // Historical notes and descriptions
  father: string | null,   // Father's external ID for relationships
  ageAtDeath: number | null,
  diedYoung: boolean,
  isSuccessionSon: boolean,
  hasMaleChildren: boolean,
  nobleBranch: string | null,
  monarchDuringLife: string[],
  generation?: number
}
```

### Smart Backup System
- **GitHub Storage**: Backups stored in repository `/backups` folder
- **Smart Naming**: `family-data_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss_[trigger].json` format
- **Backup Types**: 
  - `manual` - User-initiated backups (permanent retention)
  - `auto-bulk` - Created before bulk operations (keeps last 5)
  - `pre-restore` - Created before restore operations (keeps last 3)
- **Safety Features**: Pre-restore backup automatically created
- **Auto-cleanup**: Intelligent retention preserving manual backups

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Run `npm run dev` to start Express server + Vite dev server
2. Backend serves from `server/` directory  
3. Frontend hot-reloads from `client/` directory
4. Admin interface available at `/admin-db`

### Production Deployment
1. Azure Static Web Apps builds from GitHub
2. Frontend builds to `dist/public/`
3. Azure Functions deploy from `functions/` directory
4. Automatic GitHub sync for admin data changes

### Environment Configuration
- **GitHub Sync**: Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_REPO`
- **Cosmos DB**: Optional, requires `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_DB_PRIMARY_KEY`

## Design Philosophy

The website embodies **authentic 1500-1700s Swedish nobility aesthetics** with:
- **Historical Authenticity**: Visual elements honoring noble heritage
- **Respectful Presentation**: Content takes precedence over decoration
- **Timeless Elegance**: Subtle sophistication reflecting Swedish aristocracy
- **Modern Accessibility**: Contemporary usability with period-appropriate atmosphere
