🚀 Implementation Summary

  1. ✅ GitHub API Integration

  - Express Server: Full Octokit integration with retry logic and status management
  - Azure Functions: Native fetch-based GitHub API integration for production
  - Environment Variables: Configured for GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_REPO_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO_NAME

  2. ✅ Enhanced Existing API Endpoints

  All existing admin operations now include GitHub sync:
  - POST /api/family-members → Creates member + syncs to GitHub
  - PUT /api/family-members/{id} → Updates member + syncs to GitHub
  - DELETE /api/family-members/{id} → Deletes member + syncs to GitHub
  - POST /api/family-members/bulk-update → Bulk operations + syncs to GitHub

  3. ✅ New GitHub Sync Control Endpoints

  - GET /api/github/status → Real-time sync status and health
  - POST /api/github/test → Test GitHub connection
  - POST /api/github/retry → Manual retry failed operations
  - GET /api/github/logs → Sync operation logs

  4. ✅ Admin Interface Enhancement

  Added to existing admin page:
  - GitHub Sync Status Widget → Shows connection status, last sync, pending operations
  - Test & Retry Controls → Manual GitHub connection testing and retry buttons
  - Error Display → Verbose error messages for debugging
  - Real-time Updates → Status refreshes every 10 seconds

  5. ✅ Smart Retry Logic

  - 5-minute retry for first 3 failures
  - 1-hour retry after 3 consecutive failures
  - Manual retry option for immediate retry
  - Graceful fallback - data always saves locally even if sync fails

  6. ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow Filtering

  Updated deployment workflow:
  - [data-only] commits → Skip deployment entirely
  - Regular commits → Normal deployment process
  - Admin JSON changes → Won't trigger site rebuild

  🔧 How It Works

  User Experience:

  1. Admin makes changes in existing beautiful interface
  2. Clicks "Save Changes" → Data saves locally AND syncs to GitHub
  3. GitHub gets commit: [data-only] admin: update Lars Tygesson (ID: 0)
  4. GitHub Actions sees [data-only] → skips deployment
  5. Admin sees: "✅ Changes saved" (with sync status in widget)

  Error Handling:

  - Sync fails → Data still saved locally, queued for retry
  - Connection issues → Manual retry available
  - GitHub errors → Verbose error messages for debugging

  📝 Environment Setup Required

  You need to add these to Azure Static Web Apps settings:
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_fine_grained_token_here
  GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=mrgyllen
  GITHUB_REPO_NAME=gyllencreutz-heritage

  For local development (Replit), add to .env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_fine_grained_token_here
  GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=mrgyllen
  GITHUB_REPO_NAME=gyllencreutz-heritage

  🎯 Ready for Testing

  The admin interface now has:
  - ✅ GitHub sync status widget at the top
  - ✅ Automatic sync on every save operation
  - ✅ Verbose error messages for debugging
  - ✅ Manual test/retry controls for troubleshooting
  - ✅ No deployment triggers for data-only changes
