From below descirption I'd like you to create a /docs/solution.md file. Also, there are references to other md files in the text below, I will create those files after this in separete conversations. 

# ü§ù AI Collaboration Overview

This project is collaboratively developed using **two AI systems**:

- **Replit AI**: Responsible for UI/UX design, frontend code (React), and visual design systems.
- **Claude AI**: Responsible for backend logic, architecture, API design, and data handling.

- Include a short summary of the project
- Mention what technologies the project uses.
- Explain that the site is deployed on Azure Static Web Apps

---

## üìò Collaboration Guidelines

- Both AIs must read this `/docs/solution.md` file before working on the project.
- Replit maintains `/docs/design-guidelines.md`.
- Claude maintains `/docs/architecture-guidelines.md`.
- Each AI must keep **its section of this file** up to date.
- This file acts as the **source of truth** for overall solution intent, structure, and responsibilities.
- Do **not** maintain a full changelog ‚Äî instead, update the `_Last updated_` date at the end of your section when a change is made.
