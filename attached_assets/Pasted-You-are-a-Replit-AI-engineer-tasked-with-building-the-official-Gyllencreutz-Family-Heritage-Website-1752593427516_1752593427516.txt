You are a Replit AI-engineer tasked with building the official *Gyllencreutz Family Heritage Website*. The Gyllencreutz family is one of Sweden’s oldest noble families, and this website should beautifully showcase their history, values, and legacy across centuries. Your task is to develop a modern, interactive experience using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (ShadCN), and D3.js where relevant.

### 📚 Included Assets:
1. **`data/Gyllencreutz_Ancestry_Flat_With_BiologicalSex.json`** — a flat data file of the Gyllencreutz family lineage suitable for tree rendering.
2. **`Slutprodukt bok sista upplagan 10 feb 2024.pdf`** — a historical biography of Tyke Larsson, a key ancestor, covering 1500s Sweden.
3. **Images:** family coat of arms (`vapenskjöld.jpg`), noble mark (`Adelsmärke från kopia 2.jpg`), and symbolic horse illustration (`2 Häst.jpg`).

### 🎯 Project Scope:

#### 🔷 1. Interactive Ancestry Tree Page
Build a modular component named `GyllencreutzTree.tsx` and route it under `/gyllencreutz-tree`. This should:
- Load `Gyllencreutz_Ancestry_Flat_With_BiologicalSex.json` at runtime.
- Convert the flat data into a nested tree using a helper function like `buildTree(flatData)` (based on the `Father` field).
- Render using D3.js (`d3.hierarchy`, `d3.tree`).
- Each node displays:
  - Name
  - Born & Died years
  - Highlight succession sons (`IsSuccessionSon === true`)
  - Style node based on `BiologicalSex`
- Add interactive features:
  - Search bar to filter and zoom to individuals
  - Reset button to re-center and collapse
  - Tooltip or side panel with full info (`Notes`, `AgeAtDeath`, etc.)

#### 🔷 2. Homepage with Noble Introduction
Create a welcoming homepage `/`:
- Introduce the Gyllencreutz family as one of Sweden's oldest noble families.
- Briefly mention their registration at Riddarhuset.
- Include a tasteful section with the family coat of arms (`vapenskjöld.jpg`) and a short excerpt:
  
  > "The noble family Gyllencreutz (Adliga ätten nr 54) traces its ancestry to Lars Tykesson, a Danish-born stable-master to the Duke of Holstein, and his son Tyke Larsson, who was ennobled in Sweden during the 1500s."

- Link to the Riddarhuset listing: [https://minerva.riddarhuset.se/att/gyllencreutz/](https://minerva.riddarhuset.se/att/gyllencreutz/)

#### 🔷 3. “Legacy & Intrigue” Teaser Section
On a separate `/legacy` page, create a teaser for the historical book **"Makt, intriger och krig"** by Claes Gyllencreutz:
- Include the book cover and some selected, dramatic excerpts from the preface and early chapters (e.g., Lars Tykesson's service under Hertig Adolf of Holstein, Tyke’s journey to Sweden).
- Write an engaging short summary and offer download or purchase links:
  
  > *"Discover the gripping story of Tyke Larsson — from his noble beginnings in Schleswig to his entanglements in Nordic wars, court politics, and noble life in 16th-century Sweden. This book is a window into a forgotten era of power, conflict, and family legacy."*

- Link or refer to: `Slutprodukt bok sista upplagan 10 feb 2024.pdf`

#### 🔷 4. Optional Pages
Consider additional routes or sections such as:
- `/gallery` with `vapenskjöld.jpg`, `Adelsmärkes` imagery, and `2 Häst.jpg` with light contextual captions.
- `/about` page with info about the project's background, family members contributing, and technical credits.

---

### 📌 Constraints & Style:
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind (ShadCN components)
- Use modular design; no global CSS or DOM overrides
- Follow clean, elegant, and slightly historical design (colors from the family crest, serif fonts, soft parchment-like background optional)
